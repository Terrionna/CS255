# CS255

We were asked to create a solution for DriverPass that supports both online practice tests and in-person driving lessons. The client made it clear they needed a web-based platform that could manage customer profiles, lesson scheduling, and payment processing. I was responsible for building out the core structure of that platform through diagrams and documentation.

I think I did a solid job outlining how each part of the platform should work. The use case and activity diagrams reflect what the client described, and I kept them focused on real actions users would take. If I had to revise something, I would expand the security section. I mentioned the basics, but I could have gone into more detail about account protection and system recovery.

When I was designing, I paid attention to what the client actually said in the interview. That helped me stay focused on building something useful instead of adding extra features that weren’t asked for. Designing around real needs is the only way a system can actually be helpful to the people using it.

In future projects, I’ll keep using diagrams to map out the structure early. I’ll also be more intentional about choosing between object and process models based on what the client actually needs. I’ll continue using the same approach of building around user needs first and filling in technical details later.
